# Development of a Data Analysis and Compression Application

## Concepts

In order to do this project I had to learn some new concepts:

1. Encoding and decoding
2. Data Compression
3. Huffman Coding
4. Use of shared memory between programs

### 1. Encoding and decoding

In computers, encoding is the process of putting a sequence of characters into a specialized format for efficient transmission or storage. Decoding is the opposite process -- the conversion of an encoded format back into the original sequence of characters.

These terms should not be confused with encryption and decryption, which focus on hiding and securing data. (We can encrypt data without changing the code or encode data without deliberately concealing the content.)
