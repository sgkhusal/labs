	2. Order them in a list from the most used to the least used
	3. Create the Huffman Tree:
	- Put the 2 least used characters in the bottom branches and sum their frequencies into the top branch
	- Add the node sum back to the list, in the right order
	- Repeat the process until you have only one character on the list
	4. Create the encoding/translation table according with the Huffman Tree
	5. Encode the text using the table  ***bitwise?***
	6. Send the encoded text to the shared memory
	7. Read the info from the decoder and display it
